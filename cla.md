=============================

1. **SCOPE OF AGREEMENT.**  This Contributor License Agreement (“**Agreement**”) is a 
legal agreement that governs the interactions between GNS3 and the copyright owner or 
legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement (“**You**” or 
“**Your**”).  This Agreement will govern instances where You provide “Contributions” and 
where You license and use the GNS3 software (“**GNS3 Software**”).

2. **DEFINITIONS.**  For the purpose of this Agreement, (a) “**Contribution**” means the 
original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, 
that is intentionally submitted by You to GNS3 for inclusion in, or documentation of, any 
GNS3 Software, as described and identified on Exhibit A, and (b) “**GNS3**” means GNS3 
Technologies, Inc. and its current and future affiliates.

3. **LICENSE GRANT BY CONTRIBUTORS.**  Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, You grant to GNS3 and to recipients and users of the GNS3 Software 
(“**Users**”): (a) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, assignable, transferable, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly 
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such 
derivative works; and (b) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, assignable, transferable, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, 
import, and otherwise transfer and exploit the GNS3 Software, where such license applies 
only to those contribution and/or claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed 
by Your Contribution(s) alone or by incorporation of Your Contribution(s) with the 
GNS3 Software to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.  You acknowledge and 
agree that GNS3 grants to Users certain license rights to use the GNS3 Software for such 
User’s internal business purposes for the applicable period (“**License Term**”), which may 
also be used in connection with other software or services provided by GNS3, including 
on a pay-per-use, software-as-a-service, subscription, or similar or other basis.

4. **LICENSE GRANT RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.**  In the event that You 
provided any Contribution to GNS3 prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement (the 
“**Prior Contribution Period**”), You agree that any such item shall be deemed a 
“Contribution” hereunder, and this Agreement shall apply to such information or item as 
if conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice following the 
Effective Date of this Agreement, and You irrevocably and unconditionally waive any 
and all rights You may have, past or present, with respect to use by GNS3 in accordance 

5. **OWNERSHIP.**  You represent, warrant, and covenant that Your Contributions are 
original works of authorship and that You own all right, title, and interest, including all 
intellectual property rights, in and to the Contribution (including any and all copies 
thereof) and that You have the necessary authority to grant the license rights set forth in 
Section 3 above.  You represent and warrant that the terms under which You license Your 
Contribution to GNS3 hereunder do not limit, restrict, or conflict with GNS3’s intended 
purpose of licensing the GNS3 Software to Users.  You agree that if GNS3 receives any 
claims alleging that Your Contribution infringes any proprietary or intellectual property 
rights of any third party, GNS3 reserves the right to stop using Your Contribution and 
pass responsibility for the claim along to You, including requiring You to defend GNS3 
against the claim based solely on Your Contribution.

6. **WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.**  YOU LICENSE YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO GNS3 
ON A ROYALTY-FREE, “AS-IS” BASIS AND DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED 
OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.  
YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY MAINTENANCE OR SUPPORT 
SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE UNDER THIS 

7. **LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.**  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER GNS3 NOR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE 
RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF 
THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS OR CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER 
ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY (A) 
FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF 
SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, OR (B) FOR ANY 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF 
REVENUES AND LOSS OF PROFITS.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY LAW, GNS3’S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CAUSE 
WHATSOEVER HEREUNDER TO YOU, INCLUDING FOR ANY INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY CLAIM, SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00).

8. **BASIS OF BARGAIN.**  The warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability set forth 
above are fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between GNS3 and You.  
GNS3 would not be able to provide the Licensed Software on an economic basis without 
such limitations.  The warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability inure to the benefit 

9. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**  This Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder are 
perpetual unless terminated by GNS3.

10. **MISCELLANEOUS.**  Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this 
Agreement are assignable by You, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be 
void and without effect.  GNS3 may freely transfer and assign its rights under this 
Agreement. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, this Agreement shall be 
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas and the

Agreement shall be brought solely in the state and federal courts located in State of Texas 
with sole venue in the courts located in Austin, Texas, and each party hereby submits to 
the personal jurisdiction of such courts, except that GNS3 may seek relief in any court of 
competent jurisdiction to protect or enforce its intellectual property and proprietary 
rights.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
shall not apply to this Agreement.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is 
found to be contrary to law, then such provision shall be construed as nearly as possible 
to reflect the intention of the parties, with the other provisions remaining in full force and 
effect.  Any notice to You may be provided by email.  This Agreement constitutes the
